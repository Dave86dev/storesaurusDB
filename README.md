## About

This backend's architecture leverages a unique middleware generator pattern, utilizing lodash for parameter handling, to create dynamic and reusable middleware functions across its Express-based routing system. The generator function facilitates the abstraction of common request-processing logic into a versatile structure that accepts a callback function and a list of parameter names to extract from the request object. By employing lodash's get function, it securely retrieves these parameters, ensuring the seamless execution of operations like user authentication, file and analysis management with minimal boilerplate.

The architecture exemplifies a minimalist and efficient approach to middleware design, allowing developers to easily define complex request handling logic in a concise and readable manner. This design pattern not only simplifies the development and maintenance of the backend by reducing redundancy but also enhances scalability and flexibility, enabling the quick adaptation to new requirements or changes in business logic with minimal impact on the overall codebase.

Leveraging TypeScript in strict mode, the application integrates seamlessly with Express and Node.js to directly utilize the MongoDB driver. This approach eschews the use of an Object Document Mapper (ODM) like Mongoose, thereby optimizing performance.

User authentication is a cornerstone of this application, secured through innovative magic link techniques. By integrating Valibot for precise validation, JWT for sophisticated token management, and Mailjet for reliable email interactions, the system guarantees secure, efficient, and user-friendly authentication. This combination ensures not only the security of user data but also provides a seamless authentication experience.

For file management and analysis, the application utilizes GridFS for storage, Multer for file upload handling, and Papaparse for CSV parsing, offering robust solutions for handling large files and complex data processing.

Error management across the application is meticulously handled by restify-errors, ensuring consistent and clear error handling practices.


## Features

Current version 0.5

- **User Authentication:** Both registration and login processes are secure and thoroughly validated. Magic link rules. User can ask for it's account deactivation.

- **File Management:** We can upload large .csv files through a controlled, error-proof process. We can also delete files and retrieve them given a user.

- **File Analysis:** Choose a file you've uploaded to our database and explore it to obtain a diagnosis regarding empty data or structural deficiencies. Now you are able to store these analysis! Isn't it cool?

- **Admin manager:** Toggle user isActive accounts.

## Installation 

Get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

Don't forget to copy and rename .env.example as .env with your corresponding values.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Dave86dev/storesaurusdb

cd storesaurusdb

npm i 

npm run dev
```

## Development

While the project is currently in the early stages of backend development, it is on the brink of substantial advancements. A key feature on the roadmap is the integration of advanced file management capabilities, promising to significantly enhance the application's functionality. The actual successful implementation of an email/magic link system marks a major milestone.

Concurrently, the planning phase for the frontend development is underway, with expectations set on crafting a user interface with React-Vite-TypeScript.
